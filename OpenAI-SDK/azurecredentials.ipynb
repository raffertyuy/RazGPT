      "Yes, several other Azure AI services support the use of customer-managed keys for encryption at rest, as part of Azure's commitment to providing robust security options. Customer-managed keys (CMKs) allow customers to control the encryption keys and to implement and manage their own key lifecycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, Azure Cognitive Services, which includes services for vision, speech, language, decision, and more, allows customers to use their own keys for data encryption, giving them ownership and control over their encryption keys. This feature is very important for enterprises that have strict compliance and regulatory requirements for data security.\n",
      "\n",
      "To implement customer-managed keys with Azure services, you would typically use Azure Key Vault, which is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets, keys, and certificates. By integrating Azure Key Vault with other Azure services, you ensure that encryption keys are well-managed and protected according to your organization's security standards and compliance requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that the support for customer-managed keys may vary by service and region, and it is advisable to consult the latest Azure documentation or Azure support to get current information regarding specific services.\n"
