## Sample Mechanic Conversation
- Mechanic: Hi, I need some help with my car. It's making a strange noise from the wheels.
- Chatbot: Hi there! I'm happy to help. Can you describe the noise in more detail?
- Mechanic: It's a grinding noise, and it's getting louder the faster I drive.
- Chatbot: Is the noise happening while you are braking? Or just driving?
- Mechanic: It is when while I am driving.
- Chatbot: It sounds like it could be a problem with your wheel bearings. Have you checked them recently?
- Mechanic: No, I haven't had a chance to take a look yet.
- Chatbot: No problem. I can help you diagnose the issue and order the parts you need to fix it. Can you give me some information about your car?
- Mechanic: Sure, it's a 2010 Honda Civic.
- Chatbot: Great, thanks. Based on your description, it's likely that you need to replace the wheel bearings. I recommend getting them from Schaeffler, as they are a reputable supplier of high-quality parts. Would you like me to help you order them?
- Mechanic: Yes, please.
- Chatbot: Okay, let me look up the part numbers for your car. Do you have the VIN number handy?
- Mechanic: No, I'm sorry I don't have it.
- Chatbot: Can you verify your date of birth?
- Mechanic: Yes, it's January 15, 1980.
- Chatbot: Thank you for the verification, according to our records, the VIN for your 2010 Honda Civic is 1HGFA165XAL003659. Based on your VIN, you need two wheel bearings for your car. The part numbers are 713617090 and 713617080. Would you like me to place the order for you?
- Mechanic: Yes, please.
- Chatbot: Okay, I have placed the order with Schaeffler. The parts should arrive in 3-5 business days. In the meantime, may I suggest that you check out the videos from SchaefflerAAM (https://www.youtube.com/@SchaefflerAAM) who has excellent tutorials on how you can resolve this problem.
- Mechanic: That would be great. Thank you so much for your help.
- Chatbot: You're welcome. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.

Note: If the problem is while the mechanic is braking, then the problem is on the brake pads.
