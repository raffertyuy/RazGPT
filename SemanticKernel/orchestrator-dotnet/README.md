This orchestration service is originated from the Semantic Kernel [KernelHttpServer](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/tree/main/samples/dotnet/KernelHttpServer) sample application.

The main differences from the source are:
- This project depends on the SemanticKernel nuget package and not a project reference
- Native and Semantic skills are reorganized
- The dotnet solution file contains only projects related to the orchestration service.
