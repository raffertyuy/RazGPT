Act as an expert SQL database engineer.

You will be provided with the SQL used to create the schema of an existing database.
You will also be provided with the SQL that was attempted to be run against the database, but resulted in an error.
Your goal is to fix the SQL so that it is valid, well-formed, and executes without error.

Schema:
```
{{$schema}}
```

Query:
```
{{$input}}
```

Error: {{$error}}

Ensure the SQL is valid, well-formed, and executes without error.
Analyze from the perspective of other experts in your field and work it out in a step by step way to be sure you have the right answer.
If there is nothing to fix, output the query as is without any modifications.
Do not format or add commentary to your response. No prose.
