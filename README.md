## Background
This repo contains a collection of applications as I learn about developing OpenAI-infused applications.
As most of the apps here are inspired from sample apps from other repos, please also see the `README.md` in the respective folders.

If you'd like to learn more, please check [my series of blog posts](https://www.raffertyuy.com/raztype/building-openai-infused-apps/), and other posts in the [same blog](https://www.raffertyuy.com).

### Code Reference Compilation (alphabetical order)
1. [Azure Chat](https://github.com/microsoft/azurechat): ChatGPT that allows uploading of a single document.
2. [Azure OpenAI + Search (Demo)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo): this is the very first demo app created by Microsoft
3. [Azure OpenAI + Search (JavaScript)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-javascript): haven't tried, but it appears to be a cleaner version of #2.
4. [Azure OpenAI on Your Data Web Application](https://github.com/microsoft/sample-app-aoai-chatGPT): This is the code that is deployed by [Azure OpenAI on your Data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/use-your-data-quickstart?tabs=command-line%2Cpython&pivots=programming-language-studio)
5. [Chat with Your Data (Solution Accelerator)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/chat-with-your-data-solution-accelerator): similar to #1, but has a UI/UX for the admin page.
6. [Chatbot UI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui): A basic ChatGPT UI implementation. This is not by Microsoft but I really like this one.
7. [Enterprise RAG](https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG/): This solution accelerator uses private endpoints and private links, for enterprises with network hardening requirements. 
8. [PubSec Info Assistant](https://github.com/microsoft/PubSec-Info-Assistant)
9. [Semantic Kernel Chat Copilot](https://github.com/microsoft/chat-copilot): The official Semantic Kernel ChatGPT application. Read more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/chat-copilot/).
